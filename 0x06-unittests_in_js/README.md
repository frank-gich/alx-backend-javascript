Install Mocha using npm:

Set up a scripts in your package.json to quickly run Mocha using npm test
You have to use assert
Create a new file named 0-calcul.js:

Create a function named calculateNumber. It should accepts two arguments (number) a and b
The function should round a and b and return the sum of it
Test cases

Create a file 0-calcul.test.js that contains test cases of this function
You can assume a and b are always number
Tests should be around the “rounded” part
Tips:

For the sake of the example, this test suite is slightly extreme and probably not needed
However, remember that your tests should not only verify what a function is supposed to do, but also the edge cases
Requirements:

You have to use assert
You should be able to run the test suite using npm test 0-calcul.test.js
Every test should pass without any warning
Create a new file named 1-calcul.js:

Upgrade the function you created in the previous task (0-calcul.js)
Add a new argument named type at first argument of the function. type can be SUM, SUBTRACT, or DIVIDE (string)
When type is SUM, round the two numbers, and add a from b
When type is SUBTRACT, round the two numbers, and subtract b from a
When type is DIVIDE, round the two numbers, and divide a with b - if the rounded value of b is equal to 0, return the string Error
Test cases

Create a file 1-calcul.test.js that contains test cases of this function
You can assume a and b are always number
Usage of describe will help you to organize your test cases
